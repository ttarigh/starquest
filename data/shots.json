    "prompt": "A junior black dancer, age 11, performs a jazz routine at a dance competition. She dancers on a stage with a black backdrop featuring white printed five-point star shapes. She wears a vibrant red dance costume. It features a halter-style top with a high neckline, possibly adorned with embellishments. The mid-section of the costume has horizontal beaded detailing. The bottom half transitions into a full, short skirt with a feathered or ruffled layer over a translucent, pleated underskirt. She wears rhinestone stud earrings and a matching red flower headband. The overall impression is playful and energetic.  First, she runs to the left of the stage, hits a pose with her hands on her heart with a dramatic, sassy expression. Next, the dancer fluidly transitions from a dynamic jazz movement into a controlled chin stand, gracefully lowering their torso until their chin and chest lightly make contact with the floor. While upside down, she bends first her right knee then her left. The top half of her body is on the stage for stability while her legs extend skyward, perhaps splitting into a striking V-shape or drawing into an elegant arch, showcasing incredible flexibility and core strength before seamlessly rolling back to standing and spinning around with her arms in a downward V shape. The camera follows her movement closely.",

They perform on a stage featuring a black backdrop with flat five-point silver star shapes of varying sizes over top printed on the stage backdrop. First, they turn around and place their right hand with fingers out jazz-hands style in front of their face as if shocked. Next, they perform a synchronized right-leg fan kick where their leg makes a high arc shape like a circle starting on the ground then lifting up toward the sky while their other leg is planted on the ground. Finally, they turn around and put their hands on their backs bending their left leg popping their hips, then right in two sassy, jazz poses. They finish turning their hands back so they are looking straight at the audience. They wear black slip on jazz shoes, knee high mesh black socks, and mesh black arm sleeves. They wear matching two-piece jazz or lyrical dance costumes featuring a black base with scattered teal blue sequins. The top is a cropped, short-sleeved bolero teal jacket with an open front over a teal sequined bralette, and the bottom is a matching tiered teal skirt with a black sequined waistband. A matching hair bow with teal and black accents and rhinestone stud earrings completes the ensemble. Their hair is teased in a ponytail.  The energy is fast-paced and fierce.",

Next, one dancer toward the left begins to move, preparing for a turn on one leg with the other leg outstretched at a 90 degree angle while she turns. Next the dancers skip in a circle, fan out into a straight line and dip into a plie while sweeping the mirror in their hand from low toward the stage to high toward the sky, while following the mirror with their eyes the whole time. They then run and leap into a high grande jete in unison, performing an impressive split in the air. When they land, they hold the mirror up to their faces and look into it at their reflection, smiling and standing still. They each wear a two-piece white costume and hold an ornate white hand-held mirror in their left hand as a prop. The top is a halter-style bra with intricate white and pearlescent beadwork and lace appliques on the front, and multiple horizontal straps across the back. The bottom is a short, flowing tulle skirt with white lace and beadwork detailing on one side.",
